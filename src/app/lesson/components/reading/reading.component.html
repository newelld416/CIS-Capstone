                The acronym ARIA stands for accessible rich internet applications, and it is set of html attributes that
                developers can use to give their users a more accessible experience. It supplements HTML so that
                interactions and widgets commonly used in applications can be passed to assistive technologies when
                there is not otherwise a mechanism. For example, ARIA enables accessible navigation landmarks in HTML4,
                JavaScript widgets, form hints and error messages, live content updates, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                To highlight an example of what aria elements can do for you application we have chosen to show the HTML
                markup for a progress bar. As you can see the element we have chosen is just a div element. By itself it
                is not able to tell a screen reader what the purpose of the element is and i most certainly can not tell
                any specific details about the element. So we have added our attribute on the element. The first element
                we have added is the <strong>role</strong> attribute. This atribute is used to define the overal purpose
                of the element. the next element is <strong>aria-valuenow</strong> and is used to show the current
                progress of the loading bar. The third and fourt key attributes are <strong>aria-valuemin</strong> and
                <strong>aria-valuemax</strong> and they are used to show the min and max values of the progress bar
                respectively. All of these elements are key examples of how we as developers can add key infomation to
                elements to help with accessibility needs.

            <p>
                There are five key rules to keep in mind when it come to aria attributes.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Use native elements where you can use them</li>
                <li>Do not change native semantics, unless you really have to</li>
                <li>All interactive ARIA controls must be usable with the keyboard</li>
                <li>Do not use role="presentation" or aria-hidden="true" on a visible focusable element</li>
                <li>All interactive elements must have an accessible name</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Use native elements where you can use them</h4>
            <p>
                Essentially this rule is saying that if at all possible you should use native HTML elements when
                possible. Meaning that it is always possible to style a div element to whatever you want however if you
                want it to be a button you should be using the native HTML button element instead of making something
                else look like a button. This will save you lots of time as well as make your code more readable and
                maintainable.
            </p>
            <h4>Do not change native semantics, unless you really have to</h4>
            <p>
                This means when we have native elements like header elements we should leave those elements alone. Those
                elements often have default roles that are read by screen readers. If you must add a unique role to a
                native element like that you should add it in a wrapping tag like the example below.
            </p>
            <pre><div class="incorrect">Incorrect</div>&#x3C;h2 role=tab&#x3E;heading tab&#x3C;/h2&#x3E;</pre>
            <pre><div class="correct">Correct</div>&#x3C;div role=tab&#x3E;&#x3C;h2&#x3E;heading tab&#x3C;/h2&#x3E;&#x3C;/div&#x3E;</pre>
            <h4>All interactive ARIA controls must be usable with the keyboard</h4>
            <p>
                Efectively this rule states that if you give an HTML element a specifc role it should act like that
                role. For example, if using role=button the element must be able to receive focus and a user must be
                able to activate the action associated with the element using both the enter (on WIN OS) or return (MAC
                OS) and the space key.
            </p>
            <h4>Do not use role="presentation" or aria-hidden="true" on a visible focusable element</h4>
            <p>
                A general rule of thumb for showing and hiding elements is arai labels that describe that are not
                needed.
                When we dynamically show and hide elements the elements are added automatically. So explicitly defining
                them in the markup is not necesary.
            </p>
            <h4>All interactive elements must have an accessible name</h4>
            <p>
                There are certain elements we need to link through html attributes. The most common example of this is
                input forms. When we have an input element we often acompany that input box with a label. Now there are
                several ways that we can do that but as long as they are created as separate elements we need to link
                them. Below you can see two examples that are both syntatically correct however as you can see in the
                second example the two HTML elements are linked.

            <p>
                Contrast is defined as the state of being strikingly different from something else in juxtaposition or
                close association. Which means that in order to have good contrast we need to have different colors
                placed close to each other when designing and developing our applications. This is important for a wide
                variety of impairments such as color blindness, visual deficiencies and even screens with poor color
                resolution.
            </p>
            <p>
                The overall goal as with most accessibility examples we will talk about in this
                lesson is to provide a clear experience visually for your application.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are many types
                of users that benefit from an experience that follows this contrast requirement. Among them being
                individuals with low vision, individuals with low contrast vision or individuals with color vision
                deficiency.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="reading-container__standards">
            <h3>Standards</h3>
            <p>
                The standard contrast ratio is 4.5:1, meaning if the background is a solid color (or all black or all
                white) then the relative luminance of the text can be maintained by making sure that each of the text
                letters have 4.5:1 contrast ratio with the background. Now let’s break down what that means. If I have
                an all-black (#000000) background that means the text on that background needs to be at least 4.5 times
                brighter.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also included in this standard is Images. If the text of an image is meant to convey a message or meant
                to be understood as text, then it must meet the same accessibility standard of 4.5: 1. A good example of
                this is a company showing its logo as a jpg file in the header. The logo is meant to be subscribed as
                text and should therefore follow the contrast accessibility guideline of 4.5:1. An exception to this
                rule would be if a website had an image of a neighborhood landscape and in that landscape was the
                address of a house in the background. This is text on your webpage, however since it is not meant to
                convey a meaningful message to the user you do not have to worry about meeting accessibility guidelines.
            </p>
            <p>
                As developers and designers there are things, we can do to help mitigate contrast issues. Larger text
                has
                wider character strokes and can be much easier for the user to read at a lower contrast ratio. So, in
                examples where colors cannot be changed for a specific reason the design can implement a view with
                larger text to help alleviate the concern. With larger text (18 point or larger, or 14 point or larger
                and bold) you could use a contrast ration of 3:1 that would be acceptable for most accessibility
                guidelines. As always with these guidelines there are not many had and fast rules and we as implementors
                can be creative about how solve problems for our users. We just have to be cognizant of all of our users
                when we consider how we may solve a problem.

                Color usage is extremely important when it comes to accessibility. It can be used to differentiate
                boundaries as well as convey messages. But as with every accessible feature the goal is to ensure that
                all users can access whatever information is being conveyed by the color choices.
            </p>
            <p>
                When we think about color we often think about supporting people who experience “Color Blindness” but
                there are many other type of individuals that need to be considered, like the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Users with partial sight often experience limited color vision</li>
                <li> Some older users may not be able to see color well</li>
                <li>Users who have color-blindness benefit when information conveyed by color is available in other
                    visual ways</li>
                <li>People using text-only, limited color, or monochrome displays may be unable to access
                    color-dependent information</li>
                <li>Users who have problems distinguishing between colors can look or listen for text cues</li>
                <li>People using Braille displays or other tactile interfaces can detect text cues by touch</li>

            <h3>Standards</h3>
            <p>
                Below I will detail out several examples and reasons for why we must think about these things as we are
                designing and developing our web solutions. For a more complete exampe please refere to the "Live
                Example"
                button in the lower left hand portion of your screen.
            </p>
            <h5>Ensure information displayed by color is also displayed by text</h5>
            <p>
                An example of this would be using required language surrounding an input with an asterisk as several
                other indicators instead of just outlining the input with red color to signify a required field.
            </p>
            <pre>
&#x3C;form action=&#x22;/action_page.php&#x22;&#x3E;
    &#x3C;label style=&#x22;color: red;&#x22; for=&#x22;username&#x22;&#x3E;*Username:&#x3C;/label&#x3E;
    &#x3C;input type=&#x22;text&#x22; id=&#x22;username&#x22; name=&#x22;username&#x22; required&#x3E;
&#x3C;/form&#x3E;
            </pre>

            <form action="/action_page.php">
                <label style="color: red;" for="username">*Username:</label>
                <input type="text" id="username" name="username" required>
            </form>

            <h5>Using cues besides color to differentiate assets</h5>
            <p>
                An example of this would be how we uses different cursors to signify different capabilities. In the
                example below you can see that all of the buttons look the exact same color wise, with the exception of
                the disabled button. However you can tell what the button is intended for with the extr context the
                cusor offers.
            </p>
            <pre>

                The most important feature when it comes to interactive elements is to make them easily identifiable.
                You need to make sure that whatever disability your user is working with they understand that a button
                is a button, and a link is a link, and a form element is a form element. Now there are an infinite
                number of ways to accomplish this and there are new designs coming out daily that make it easier and
                easier for a user to identify these elements. In this lesson we will talk about some of the common
                failures we see across many sites and some of the easiest ways to drive a consistent and easily
                recognizable experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here is a list of some common interactive elements that we see often can cause accessibility issues
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using &#x3C;div&#x3E; elements that act like &#x3C;button&#x3E; elements</li>
                <li>Using input fields without an attached label</li>
                <li>Using only one method to provide user feedbak</li>
                <li>Using mouse interactions solely to convey focus</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="reading-container__standards">
            <h3>Standards</h3>
            <p>
                The first failure that we talked about was using generic HTML elements to accomplish a task that can be
                solved more easily with native HTML elements. The classic example that comes up is using elements like
                &#x3C;a&#x3E; and &#x3C;span&#x3E; to accomplish what is needed by a button element. This inherently
                causes isses for tools like screen readers that are relient on these native elements to understand the
                purpose of the element. There are always things you can do to make them act hte same way however you are
                always going to ad more work that is unnecesssary to the orginal goal of the element. Below you can see
                a list of things you would need to consider if using an &#x3C;a&#x3E; element to act as a button.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>&#x3C;button&#x3E; has a button role, &#x3C;a href&#x3E; has a link role</li>
                <li>&#x3C;a href=&#x201D;#&#x201D; role=&#x201D;button&#x201D;&#x3E; only works with click and enter
                    key, &#x3C;button&#x3E; works with spacebar also</li>
                <li>Focus jumps to top of page when user activates an &#x3C;a href=&#x201D;#&#x201D;&#x3E; control
                    whereas focus stays put on a &#x3C;button&#x3E;</li>
                <li>&#x3C;button&#x3E; looks like a Button, &#x3C;a href&#x3E; looks like a Link</li>
                <li>If you forget the href attribute, i.e. &#x3C;a onclick&#x3E; then there is NO role, NO keyboard
                    focusability, and NO enter key activation. &#x3C;a&#x3E; is basically the same as a &#x3C;span&#x3E;
                    unless you have the href attribute</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The second failure that we spoke about was one that we have already covered in our lesson about ARIA
                elements but we will show the example again as a refresher.
            </p>

            <pre><div class="incorrect">Incorrect</div>&#x3C;label&#x3E;user name&#x3C;/label&#x3E; &#x3C;input type=&#x22;text&#x22;&#x3E;</pre>
            <pre><div class="correct">Correct</div>&#x3C;label for=&#x22;uname&#x22;&#x3E;user name&#x3C;/label&#x3E; &#x3C;input type=&#x22;text&#x22; id=&#x22;uname&#x22;&#x3E;</pre>

            <p>
                Another very simple mistake we make when it comes to interactive elements is making sure we consicer
                users who are unable or unwilling to use a mouse. The key area we miss is the difference we miss between
                hover and focus. Hover is inacted when a users mouse hovers overa specific element. It allows us to
                change the visualization of that element often times showing that it is clickable or that the user can
                take action against it. What we miss as developers is when a user is not using a mouse, we also need to
                take into account that the same visualization que is taken when the element obtains focus. This is done
                through the user using non mouse capabilities to navigate your expereience. For example when a user tabs
                through a form how do we show the users which element is in focus in the same manner that we would if
                the hovered of those elements. As an example below you cann see how both CSS selectors are used to
                describe
                the styling.

                Navigation is one of the most imperative elements when it comes to creating an accessible site.
                Navigation elements are the mainf capability that allow users to traverse and navigate your expereience.
                Even users without accessibility needs have experienced how difficult it is to navigate a web experience
                if you can't understand how to move around. It can be off putting and frustrating and can be cause for
                users to jsut abandone your experience all together. Navigation is also something that can change
                drastically between different screen sizes. Often time how you navigate a desktop expereience can be
                very different then how you navigate a tablet experience and how you navigate a tablet expereience can
                often be very different then how you navigate a mobile experience. Below I have used Amway web
                expereiencesto show you three examples of the same site in different screen sizes to show yo uhow
                different navigation experiences.

                To support best practices around navigation there are some key elements we need to consider, structure
                and styling. Structure referes to the semantic markup that conveys the menu structure to users. Menus
                coded semantically can easily adapt to different situations, such as small screen displays, screen
                magnification, and other assistive technology. While Style is the act of making something look the way a
                user expects it to look.
            </p>
            <h4>Structure</h4>
            <p>
                It is important to use key native elements when developing the structure of you navigation cability.
                This wil ensure that your navigation elements work well under multiple conditions as well as work well
                with assistive technologies such as screen readers. As you can see in the example below there are native
                navigation elements like the &#x3C;nav&#x3E; tag and the use of the role attribute. As well as the use
                of several ARIA attributes for assistive technologies. For a more complete example please click on the
                "Live Example" button in the lower left hand part of your screen.

            <h4>Styling</h4>
            <p>
                When it comes to styling your navigation components there are elements in which you can be createive but
                it is important to keep in mind that users expect to see thing in a logical manner. For examle when a
                user is browsing websites on their desktop they expect the navigation to clearly be called out at the
                top of the page. When a user is on a mobile device a user is familiar with a haburger menu that expands
                to a flyout menu filled with accordions that facilitate sub menus. The familiar interactions are hugely
                beneficial for everyday users but the become critical when users a expereienceing accessibility
                difficulties.

                The more common we can make our experiences and stadardized we construst our application the easier it
                can be for all individuals to navigate the web as a whole.

                There are many ways in which we can provide user feedback, such as confirming form submission, alerting
                the user when something goes wrong, or notifying the user of changes on the page. Instructions should be
                easy to identify. Important feedback that requires user action should be presented in a prominent style.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this lesson we will go through a couple of examples to show you how user feedback can be implemented
                within you pplication.

                The first example that we will go through is a classic user input form. This is a common example that
                many designers and developers have had to create for a myriad of different problems. Our form will be a
                simple user name input submission form. It will allow the user to enter their first and last name, then
                submit the form.
